Summary
Round 1
The first round was played from 16 to 18 August, as the best of five frames. On the first day, defending champion Higgins made his 12th competitive maximum break, in the first frame of his 3–1 win against Alexander Ursenbacher. At 46 years and 90 days, Higgins broke his own record as the oldest man to make a maximum break in competition. He had previously been the oldest player to make one after completing a maximum at the Championship League in October 2020. Higgins became the player with the second most maximum breaks, behind Ronnie O'Sullivan with 15, and now ahead of Stephen Hendry.
World number one Judd Trump trailed 1–2 to Mitchell Mann, but won 3–2. Despite making two century breaks, Kyren Wilson was defeated by Ashley Hugill 2–3. Mark Allen and Reanne Evans, who had been in a relationship between 2005 and 2008, met in the first round. The players, who had been in legal battles over child maintenance, had their first professional meeting at the event. Evans refused to shake hands with Allen before the match, and led 2–1, but missed the match ball and Allen completed a clearance to win the contest. The finalists of the 2021 World Snooker Championship, Shaun Murphy and Mark Selby met in the first round. World champion Selby won the match 3–2. Four-time winner Hendry met Chris Wakelin in the first round. Hendry won the match 3–2, his first main tournament win since rejoining the tour in 2020 after retiring in 2012. Lukas Kleckers won the final two frames against Masters champion Yan Bingtao to win 3–2.

Round 2
The second round was played on 18 and 19 August as the best of five frames. The 1997 winner Mark Williams recovered from 0–2 behind to Dominic Dale in a 3–2 victory. Iranian player Hossein Vafaei defeated Allen 3–2, despite having never beaten him in four prior meetings. Stephen Maguire defeated Martin O'Donnell 3–2, but complained about O'Donnell's slow play, who had averaged more than 30 seconds per shot. Ali Carter described playing reigning world champion Selby as a "dream draw", and won the match 3–0. Higgins trailed Cao Yupeng 1–2, but made breaks of 95 and 96 to win the match. Higgins lost the third frame of the match after missing a shot, blaming the red ball having a stray hair on it. Hendry played Gary Wilson and lost 0–3. Neither player made a break above 50. Wilson called the performance "an embarrassment".

Rounds 3 and 4
The third and fourth rounds were played on 20 August also as the best of five frames. Trump played Elliot Slessor losing 2–3. The loss meant that Selby would now be ranked as the world number one after the event. Slessor went on to face Carter in the fourth round. Carter made the second maximum break of the event in the second round, but only won that frame, losing 1–3. Ricky Walden completed a 3–1 win over Higgins, and then defeated Ross Muir by the same scoreline. Williams made breaks of 71 and 70 as he defeated Liam Highfield 3–0. Williams played Zhang Jiankang in the fourth round, where he was the sole player from the top 16 remaining. Zhang led 2–1 and was within four pots of winning the match, but missed a routine black ball, and eventually lost 2–3. David Gilbert, who had won his first ranking event at the preceding Championship League event, reached the quarter-finals where he drew Wilson, who had defeated Vafaei.

Quarter-finals
The quarter-finals were played on 21 August as the best of seven frames. Gilbert played Wilson, and led both 2–0 and 3–2, but lost the match after missing a pot using a long rest. Slessor met Zhou Yuelong and won 4–3 to reach his second ranking event semi-final. Williams played Ricky Walden in the quarter-finals. Williams won 4–3 on the final black, despite Walden making four breaks over 50. Williams commented that despite the win, he "couldn't string three pots together", and that the players he had faced in the tournament had lost matches, rather than him winning them. Robertson played Lu Ning in the final quarter-final match, winning 4–2.

Semi-finals
The semi-finals were contested on 21 August as the best of seven frames. Wilson played Slessor, but trailed 0–2. He won the next three frames with breaks of 67, 68 and 100 to lead 3–2, before Slessor made a 125 break to force a deciding frame. Wilson won the frame to reach his second ranking final. Williams completed breaks of 60, 73 and 58 in a 4–1 win over Robertson.

Final
The final was played between Williams and Wilson on 22 August as the best of eleven frames. Williams won the opening frame, before Wilson tied the match in frame two. A break of 111 in frame three for Williams was his first century break of the event, before Wilson won frame four. Wilson won frame five with a break of 101 to lead the match for the first time, Williams winning back-to-back frames to lead 4–3. Wilson won frame eight to tie the match, but Williams won the next two frames to complete a 6–4 victory. This was Williams's 24th ranking event title, and his second British Open title, 24 years since he last won the event in 1997. Aged 46, Williams was the third oldest person to win a ranking event, only behind Ray Reardon in 1982 (50) and Doug Mountjoy in 1989 (46). Williams commented that he had been lucky to progress to the final, but that his performance in the final was the best he had played in the tournament. Wilson said he was "bitterly disappointed" not to win.
